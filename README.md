# Reg-Lang
Reg-Lang is a statically-typed programming language currently in development. It is built with Rust and uses LLVM as its compiler infrastructure.

Reg-Lang aims to be a simple, easy-to-learn language for beginners, while also providing more advanced features for experienced developers. The language supports basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, char and booleans.

Reg-Lang features control flow statements like if/else statements and while loops, and supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as comparison operators like ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, and ``>=``.

> Note: Reg-Lang is still in development, and more features are planned for future releases. Stay tuned for updates!
> For now, only the Parser and Lexer are implemented.
