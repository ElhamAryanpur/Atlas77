# What is Atlas77
**Blablablablabla I'm trying to make a language in Rust**

# Example
```rs
let fib: (n: i64) -> i64 =
  match n with
  | 0 => 0,
  | 1 => 1,
  \ _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

let main: () -> i64 = fib(10)
```

# State
Currently the language is heavily in development and not suitable for any production purposes.
