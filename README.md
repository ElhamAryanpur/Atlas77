# Milestone:

## v0.0.1-alpha
### Features

- Parser & Lexer Implementation: A functional parser and lexer have been implemented, forming the core of the language's processing pipeline.
- Simple Runtime: The runtime environment has been established using a Tree Walker approach, allowing the execution of code written in the language.
- Basic Language Features: Most fundamental language features have been incorporated, including:
  - Definition of structures (structs) for complex data types
  - Enumeration (enums) to define a set of named values
  - Function support for code organization and reusability
  - Constants (consts) to represent unchangeable values
  - Initial compiler directives to guide the compilation process

### Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project's `v0.0.1-alpha` release is to provide an early version of the language that can undergo testing and evaluation by users. This release aims to accomplish the following goals:

- Gather User Feedback: By making this alpha version available, we seek to collect valuable insights from users. This feedback will help us identify potential issues and areas for improvement in the language.
- Feature Validation: Through user testing, we aim to validate the implemented features and identify any gaps or areas of refinement.
- Feature Suggestions: We welcome user suggestions for additional features that can enhance the language. This input will guide the roadmap for future releases.
- Bug Identification: Users should anticipate encountering bugs and incomplete functionalities, and we encourage reporting these issues to aid in their resolution.

> Note: The v0.0.1-alpha release signifies an early stage in the language's development. Users should be aware that certain features might be incomplete or absent. Due to the experimental nature of this release, it is not recommended for use in production environments. The purpose of this alpha version is to facilitate exploration, testing, and feedback collection.
